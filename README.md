**NOTES:**
I wanted to add features like a slider picker for price range, more animations, a product comparison tool, and more advanced filters. Unfortunately, I ran out of time. This code challenge was very interesting to me, and I had a great time working on it. I hope you find it satisfactory. :blush:
